Weather Dashboard

This webpage allows for the user to search a city by name, and returns the weather for that city.  The data returned includes current weather, and weather forecast for the next 5 days.  The site uses a third-party API to access weather data by location.  The site also saves searches and should allow the user to click on a previous search term to pull up the weather for that location(*note: I was unable to get the button links of the search history to work, the list populates but cannot be used to access weather data)

The site should follow the following conditions:
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
